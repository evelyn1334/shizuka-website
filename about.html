                    <h2 class="title">About Shizuka Miura</h2>
                    <p>Shizuka Miura (<strong>三浦静香</strong>) was a Japanese doll-maker and musician who created many works of unearthly beauty during her lifetime.</p>
                    <p>An apprentice of the legendary doll-maker Katan Amano (<strong>天野可淡</strong>), Shizuka started her artistic career making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_jointed_doll" target="_blank">ball-jointed dolls</a>. Then, under the influence of her husband Maki Miura (<strong>三浦真樹</strong>), a seasoned guitarist who had played in such notable acts as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Rallizes_D%C3%A9nud%C3%A9s" target="_blank">Les Rallizes Dénudés</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushitsusha" target="blank">Fushitsusha</a>, she began writing songs based on her poems. Before long, with the help of Maki and a couple of other underground musicians, around the frontwoman emerged a band &mdash; simply called Shizuka (<strong>静香</strong>).</p>
                    <p>During the mid-1990s, Shizuka's music career was up to a brilliant start. Subsequently they were invited to perform overseas in California and Scotland, in 1996 and 2001 respectively. However, due to a number of internal problems, mainly financial and health ones, the band gradually became moribund.</p>
                    <p>At the end of <strong>January 2010</strong>, Shizuka Miura <a href="http://ongakublog.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/shizuka-r-i-p/" target="_blank">committed suicide</a> for reasons still unclear. This website was made in dedication to her memory.</p>
